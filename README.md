# CanvasPlotter
An amateur attempt to create a 2D graph plotting library with C#, using WPF Canvas element.

Folders CanvasProjectA, B, C and D was my* crude version control system and can be (should be) ignored.

CanvasPlotter folder stores the full code and the dll

CanvasProjectE is the most recent example code for this project.

More info will be added soon.
