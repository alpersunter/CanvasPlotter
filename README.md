# CanvasPlotter
An amateur attempt to create a 2D plotting library with C#, using WPF Canvas element.

Folders CanvasProjectA, B, C and D was my* crude version control system and can be (should be) ignored.

CanvasPlotter folder stores the full code (and you can compile it as a dll)

CanvasProjectE is the most recent example code for this project.

More info will be added soon.
